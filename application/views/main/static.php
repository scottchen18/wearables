		<h1> About Us</h1>
		
		<p class="p2">The momentum behind wearable technology is immense and its growing fast. IDC reports that global wearable device shipments will reach over 19 million by the end of 2014 and this will grow exponentially to nearly 112 million by 2018.</p>

		<p class="p2">Despite the fact that this technology is quite new, the landscape is already getting quite complex with many different categories of wearables emerging from smartwatches to smart glasses, biometric shirts and brain-sensing headgear.</p>

		<p class="p2">We Are Wearables was created to help people and businesses navigate through the emerging space of wearable technology. We do this by making wearables accessible and opening a dialogue to understand how these new devices impact our everyday lives.</p>

		<p class="p2">Our regular community events brings together thought leaders, hardware manufacturers and software developers to discuss the wearable space and often showcase and launch new technology to the market. They always feature dedicated time to network with those in the industry and most importantly provide an opportunity for the attendees to get their hands on the technology that is often not even on the market.</p>

		<p class="p2">To further the education of wearables, we also offer workshops and company lunch and learns designed to inspire developers, designers, product managers and others interested in wearables to start their own journey in incorporate wearable technology in their professional roles.</p>

		<p class="p2">This site also serves as a resource for wearable tech as we share stories of the people, teams and technology leading the charge in this emerging space in interviews, articles and video.</p> 

		<p class="p2">We are doing this because we know one thing is for certain, in order for wearable technology to succeed it needs all of us. And together, We Are Wearables.
